SMAII revision session.

Exam walkthrough 2014:
	->	Q1a.	About Semantic Web technologies, give definitions and explain
				how they are related to one another. (Use Layer Cake to demonstrate this)
				-	Give an example such as an RDF example ie. "Student is taking exam"
		
		Q1b.	Give an opinion, can use bullet points, expected to know basics of Web 2.0,
				demonstrate similarities and give reasons.
				
	->	Schema Matching won't be on the exam, disregard Q2 2014

	->	Q4.		We spent a lot more time on Social Media Analysis, so it's likely we'll have
				at least two questions on the topic. 
		
		Q4a.	Give a real world example, can use SMA to spot weaknesses, who is influential,
				opinion examples.
		
		Q4b.	We looked at Metrics quite a lot and used them as a basis for anaylsis. We studied
				8 metrics, 4 for node (foucesed on centrality)
		
		Q4ci.	Know how to calculate metrics
		
		Q4cii.	Highlight betweeness centrality and closeness centrality, Node D is not in a pivotal position.
		
Exam Walkthrough 2013:
	->	Q1.		Can be ignored.
		
	->	Q2b.	Description element, about tag, resource, propery and value pairs. Not looking for exact syntax
				just general structure.
				
	->	Q3a.	Can be ignored.
		
		Q3b.	Should be able to answer this. New information, automatic classification, make sure it's consistant.
		
	->	Q4a.	Can be ignored.
		
		Q4b.	Can be ignored.
		
		Q4c.	Similar to 2014 Q1b, 14 marks so 15 minutes each short essay can be written in bullet points. 3-4 arguments each essay.
				Standardisation W3C Web 2.0 can be developed ad-hoc, Semantic Web not as well known though it is widely used.
				
General Notes: 
	->	There was no question on Visualisation, Propagation, Structure and Content, Tie Strength (Topics: 2, 3, 4, 5).
		Each too small for full question, could be half a question each.
		
	->	Could be a question on Sparkle queries, don't need to know exact syntax but we should know how to formulate overall structure.
